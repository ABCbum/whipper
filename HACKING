unicode
-------
- All text files should be read and written as unicode.
- All strings that came from the outside should be converted to unicode objects.
- Use asserts liberally to ensure this so we catch problems earlier.
- All gst.parse_launch() pipelines should be passed as utf-8; use
  encode('utf-8')
- morituri.extern.log.log is not unicode-safe; don't pass it unicode objects;
  for example, always use %r to log paths
- run with RIP_DEBUG=5 once in a while to catch unicode/logging errors.
