TODO:
- at least mention the data track somewhere in the log
- check pregaps more than once, to see if results are consistent, or with
  different methods
- handle errors on cdrdao spawning (for example, not having cdrecorder,
  or not putting the disk in)
- check if it's simple to listen to each track in a multitrack completing
- save trms to a pickle, after finishing each track
- add a way to store configuration data per drive, like offset
- rip the data session
- add AccurateRip validation for ripped images to rip command
- add GUI
- persist RipResult so rips can be aborted and continued too; needs verification
  of previously ripped files
- write moovida plugin
- cache results of MusicBrainz lookups
- on ana, Goldfrapp tells me I have offset 0!
- don't keep short HTOA's if their peak level is low
  (see Pixies Planet of Sound single)
- lossy encoding
- consider basing ripping progress not only on read (reaches 100% before
  writes are done) or writes (very bursty in cdparanoia) but a combo of the
  two, each counting for half.
