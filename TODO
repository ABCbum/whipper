MILESTONES:
- read CD TOC including pre-gap information
- detect read offset
  (using a CD in AccurateRip and ripping with various offsets)
  (can be delayed since we can get the number from EAC)
- rip a CD with HTOA and other pre-gap tracks, creating separate track for HTOA
- parse .toc files (see cdrdao)

TODO:
- handle errors on cdrdao spawning (for example, not having cdrecorder,
  or not putting the disk in)
- check if it's simple to listen to each track in a multitrack completing
- save trms to a pickle, after finishing each track
