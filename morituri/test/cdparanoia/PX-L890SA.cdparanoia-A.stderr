cdparanoia III release 10.2 (September 11, 2008)

Using cdda library version: 10.2
Using paranoia library version: 10.2
Checking /dev/cdrom for cdrom...
	Testing /dev/cdrom for SCSI/MMC interface
		SG_IO device: /dev/sr0

CDROM model sensed sensed: PLEXTOR DVDR   PX-L890SA 1.05 
 

Checking for SCSI emulation...
	Drive is ATAPI (using SG_IO host adaptor emulation)

Checking for MMC style command set...
	Drive is MMC style
	DMA scatter/gather table entries: 1
	table entry size: 524288 bytes
	maximum theoretical transfer: 222 sectors
	Setting default read size to 27 sectors (63504 bytes).

Verifying CDDA command set...
	Expected command set reads OK.

Attempting to set cdrom to full speed... 
	drive returned OK.

=================== Checking drive cache/timing behavior ===================

Seek/read timing:

	[20:00.00]:   22ms seek, 0.44ms/sec read [30.0x]                 
	[10:00.00]:   30ms seek, 0.52ms/sec read [25.7x]                 
	[00:00.00]:   33ms seek, 0.70ms/sec read [18.9x]                 

Analyzing cache behavior...
	Fast search for approximate cache size... 0 sectors            	Slow verify for approximate cache size... 0 sectors..........	Drive does not cache nonlinear access                            

Drive tests OK with Paranoia.
