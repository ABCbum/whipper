morituri is a CD ripper aiming for accuracy over speed.
Its features are modeled to compare with Exact Audio Copy on Windows.

This is morituri 0.1.0 "Youngblood", the first public release of morituri!
This is intended as a release for daring and curious people who've had enough
of the fact that Windows has a more accurate CD ripper than Linux.

This is a release to open up morituri to wider feedback and to start having
people using it.

FEATURES
--------
- support for MusicBrainz for metadata lookup
- support for AccurateRip verification
- detects sample read offset of drives
- performs test and copy rip
- detects and rips Hidden Track One Audio
- templates for file and directory naming
- support for lossless encoding only for now
- tagging using GStreamer
- for now, only a command line client (rip) is shipped

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- cdparanoia, for the actual ripping
- cdrdao, for session, TOC, pregap, and ISRC extraction
- GStreamer and its python bindings, for encoding
- python musicbrainz2, for metadata lookup
- pycdio, for drive identification (optional)

GETTING MORITURI
----------------

If you are building from a source tarball or checkout, you can choose to
use morituri installed or uninstalled.

- getting:
  - Change to a directory where you want to put the morituri source code
    (For example, $HOME/dev/ext or $HOME/prefix/src)
  - source: download tarball, unpack, and change to its directory
  - checkout:
    svn co https://thomas.apestaart.org/morituri/svn/trunk morituri
    cd morituri
    ./autogen.sh

- building:
  ./configure
  make

- you can now choose to install it or run it uninstalled.
  - installing:
    make install
  - running uninstalled:
    ln -sf `pwd`/misc/morituri-uninstalled $HOME/bin/morituri-trunk
    morituri-trunk
    (this drops you in a shell where everything is set up to use morituri)

RUNNING MORITURI
----------------

morituri currently only has a command-line interface called 'rip'

rip is self-documenting.
rip -h gives you the basic instructions.

rip implements a tree of commands; for example, the top-level 'changelog'
command has a number of sub-commands.

Positioning of arguments is important;
  rip cd -d (device) rip
is correct, while
  rip cd rip -d (device)
is not, because the -d argument applies to the rip command.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

The simplest way to get started making accurate rips is:

- pick a relatively popular CD that has a good change of being in the
  AccurateRip database
- find the drive's offset by running
  rip offset find
- wait for it to complete; this might take a while
- optionally, confirm this offset with two more discs
- rip the disc by running
  rip cd rip --offset (the number you got before)
  
FILING BUGS
-----------

morituri's bug tracker is at https://thomas.apestaart.org/morituri/trac/
When filing bugs, please run the failing command with the environment variable
RIP_DEBUG set; for example:

  RIP_DEBUG=5 rip offset find > morituri.log 2>&1
  gzip morituri.log

And attach the gzipped log file to your bug report.
