Checking for SCSI emulation...
	Drive is ATAPI (using SG_IO host adaptor emulation)

Checking for MMC style command set...
	Drive is MMC style
	DMA scatter/gather table entries: 167
	table entry size: 524288 bytes

Verifying CDDA command set...
	Expected command set reads OK.

Attempting to set cdrom to full speed... 
	drive returned OK.

=================== Checking drive cache/timing behavior ===================

Seek/read timing:
	[45:24.28]:   46ms seek, 1.26ms/sec read [10.6x] spinning up...  	[45:24.27]:   45ms seek, 1.25ms/sec read [10.6x] spinning up...  	[45:24.26]:   45ms seek, 1.26ms/sec read [10.6x] spinning up...  	[45:24.25]:   44ms seek, 1.26ms/sec read [10.6x] spinning up...  	[45:24.24]:   45ms seek, 1.26ms/sec read [10.6x]                 
	[40:00.00]:   50ms seek, 1.31ms/sec read [10.2x]                 
	[30:00.00]:   64ms seek, 1.46ms/sec read [9.1x]

	Verifying that cache is contiguous.......................	Drive cache tests as contiguous                           
	Testing background readahead past read cursor... 64           .	Testing background readahead past read cursor... 128           .	Testing background readahead past read cursor... 192           .	Testing background readahead past read cursor... 256           .	Testing background readahead past read cursor... 320           ..o.	Testing background readahead past read cursor... 264           .	Testing background readahead past read cursor... 272           ..o.	Testing background readahead past read cursor... 265           ..o...o...o..	Drive readahead past read cursor: 264 sector(s)                
	Testing cache tail cursor...........o	Cache tail cursor tied to read cursor                      
	Testing granularity of cache tail..................o	Cache tail granularity: 1 sector(s)                      
	Cache size (considering rollbehind) too small to test cache speed.

Drive tests OK with Paranoia.
