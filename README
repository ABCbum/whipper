morituri is a CD ripper aiming for accuracy over speed.
Its features are modeled to compare with Exact Audio Copy on Windows.

FEATURES
--------
- support for MusicBrainz for metadata lookup
- support for AccurateRip verification
- detects sample read offset of drives
- performs test and copy rip
- detects and rips Hidden Track One Audio
- templates for file and directory naming
- support for lossless encoding only for now
- tagging using GStreamer
- for now, only a command line client (rip) is shipped

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- cdparanoia, for the actual ripping
- cdrdao, for session, TOC, pregap, and ISRC extraction
- GStreamer and its python bindings, for encoding
- python musicbrainz2, for metadata lookup
- pycdio, for drive identification (optional)

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
- cdrdao read-toc does not always get pregaps right compared to EAC, still
  under investigation

GOALS
-----
- quality over speed
- support one-command automatic ripping
- support offline ripping (doing metadata lookup and log rewriting later)
  - separate the info/result about the rip from the metadata/file generation/...
